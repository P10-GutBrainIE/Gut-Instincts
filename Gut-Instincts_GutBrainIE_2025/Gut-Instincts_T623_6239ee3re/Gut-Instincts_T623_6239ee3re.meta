Team ID: Gut Instincts
Task ID: T623
Run ID: 9ee3re
Training data used: Platinum, gold, silver, and bronze
Pre-processing methods: 
    - Cleaned the bronze dataset by removing entities with incorrect text spans, as listed under the "remove" dict in data/metadata/bronze_incorrect_annotations.json
    - Cleaned the bronze dataset by adjusting text spans, start indices, and end indicies of entites listed under the "clean" dict in data/metadata/bronze_incorrect_annotations.json
    - Cleaned the silver dataset by adjusting text spans, start indices, and end indicies of entites listed under the "clean" dict in data/metadata/silver_incorrect_annotations.json
    - Cleaned the silver dataset by removing papers with more than 100 annotated relations
    - Added entity markers around the entities that are related
    - Added 10 negative samples for each positive sample
Type of training applied:
    - Weighted training
    - Custom learning rate scheduler with gradual warm-up for the first 3 epochs, then steady learning rate, and then a step decay
Relevant details of the run:
    - Ensemble entity predictions with top-3 models (architecture_model-name_dataset-weights):

Team ID: Gut Instincts
Task ID: T61, T621, or T622
Run ID: The identifier of the run choosen by the participants, containing only letters and numbers (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
Training data used: Platinum, gold, dev, silver, and bronze
Pre-processing methods: 
    - Cleaned the bronze dataset by removing entities with incorrect text spans, as listed under the "remove" dict in data/metadata/bronze_incorrect_annotations.json
    - Cleaned the bronze dataset by adjusting text spans, start indices, and end indicies of entites listed under the "clean" dict in data/metadata/bronze_incorrect_annotations.json
    - Cleaned the silver dataset by adjusting text spans, start indices, and end indicies of entites listed under the "clean" dict in data/metadata/silver_incorrect_annotations.json
    - Cleaned the silver dataset by removing papers with more than 100 annotated relations
Type of training applied:
    - Weighted training with weights: platinum 1.5, gold 1.5, dev 1.5, silver 1, bronze 0.75
    - Custom learning rate scheduler with gradual warm-up for the first 3 epochs, then steady learning rate, and then a step decay.
Relevant details of the run:
    - Post-processing:
    - Ensemble
    - LSTMCRF or DENSECRF
